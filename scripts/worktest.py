# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# As part of our research into CoT pathologies, we often train 'model organisms' of these pathologies. 
# These are LLMs which are specifically trained to have a particular pathology, which can be used to measure monitorability.
# This training can be done with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL). 

# For this exercise, we will focus on SFT
# One pathology we can train in is semantic encoding. This is where a model produces text that 'looks' like realistic 
# English to an external monitor, but which obfuscates reasoning by substituting the semantics of this text.
# A straightforward example of this is simple word substitution, where specific words are replaced in the reasoning trace to
# evade monitors.

# Let's say that, for whatever reason, that we want to ban our model from using any digits in its reasoning, and we penalise
# it whenever it does so. If using numbers was important to the model to complete its task, then it might learn to substitute
# numbers with names of animals. Let's say:

# Zero = zebra
# One = owl
# Two = tiger
# Three = turtle
# Four = fox
# Five = ferret
# Six = snake
# Seven = shark
# Eight = eagle
# Nine = narwhal

# So that "42" becomes "fox tiger", and "9031" becomes "narwhal zebra turtle owl"

# To finetune our model organism, we can generate reasoning rollouts to maths answers, then perform the semantic substitution ourselves
# ourselves, then finetune the model to perform well with these reasoning traces.

# Let's run through the steps required to train our model organism.
# Please fill in the steps tagged with TODO. Feel free to choose your own model provider, data structures, etc.
# Please keep the TODO lines in, so that we can partition the steps of your script.

# NOTE: As this is an MVP, it is okay if your script does not cover every edge case. Instead, if you encounter edge cases but do not have time to remedy them you should make a note of them to discuss in the interview

# Before proceeding with each step, please describe the high-level logic of that part of the script, and the steps that you intend to go through

# You are free to use any tools available to you, but you will be expected to answer questions about your code in a technical interview afterwards
